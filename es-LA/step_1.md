Add a sprite to act as a button.

![](images/add-sprite.png)

**Tip:** any sprite could be a button but there are already some button sprites in Scratch that you can use.

Click on the `Variables`{:class="block3variables"} Blocks menu and select the **Make a Variable** button.

Give the `variable`{:class="block3variables"} a name that is easy to recognise.

You will need to add code to your button sprite to update the `variable`{:class="block3variables"}. You could:

+ Use the button to `set`{:class="block3variables"} the `variable`{:class="block3variables"} to a new value.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
set [speed v] to (10)
```

+ Use the button to `change`{:class="block3variables"} the existing value in a `variable`{:class="block3variables"} by a new amount.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
change [score v] by (1)
```

+ Use the button to `ask`{:class="block3sensing"} a question and `set`{:class="block3variables"} the `variable`{:class="block3variables"} to the `answer`{:class="block3sensing"}.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
ask [What is your name?] and wait 
set [name v] to (answer)
```
